#### Leadership and Influence:

-  As a research intern at Kkem Knowledge Community, I conducted skill gap assessments and career aspiration surveys. As an NCC cadet, I volunteered extensively, anchored events, and honed my public speaking skills. This blend of research and leadership experiences has significantly strengthened my communication and analytical abilities. 

#### Networking:

- Through my experience in NCC, I've developed strong networking skills, easily befriending people from diverse backgrounds and states. My ability to communicate politely and professionally has helped me build meaningful connections and continuously gain new knowledge.

#### Career Plan:

- I aspire to become a software developer, honing my skills in the latest technologies. My goal is to continuously gain knowledge, explore new innovations, and ultimately succeed as a top-level professional in the IT field.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala, with its educated populace and strong work ethic, is poised to become a leader in India's tech startup ecosystem. To unlock its full potential, the state can focus on several key areas. These include nurturing a talent pool versed in digital technologies, fostering collaboration between academia and industry, and building a robust infrastructure for funding and business support. By prioritizing these aspects, Kerala can cultivate an environment that empowers innovation and attracts talent, propelling it to the forefront of India's tech future.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

-I recently completed two basic projects: a Quiz Game Application and CodeMate-a live code editor for HTML, CSS, and JS. As a beginner without industry experience, I self-learned through resources like Google. Additionally, I developed my college main project, Collegiate Chatter, a college enquiry chatbot with innovative features, and published it in the International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT). These projects reflect my commitment to learning and contributing to the open-source community, showcasing my ability to independently create functional and innovative software solutions.
#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I actively engage in community platforms such as LinkedIn, Discord, and LeetCode. On LinkedIn, I share updates, certificates, and stay informed about technical news. While less active on Discord, I primarily use it for learning purposes. LeetCode is my go-to for honing coding and DSA skills, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and staying connected within the tech community.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I post my all of my Technical growths in my linkedin, in there my main growth is the personal project do by self.
